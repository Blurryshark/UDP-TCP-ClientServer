# CST311 Assignments

This repository contains programming assignments for CST311.

Please note that assignments may change up until assignment date (and potentially after if there is confusion).
Therefore, if you start assignments prior to their official submission date please make sure to update your local repository (see [updating](#updating) section below for more details).

## Getting started

To start working on projects please [fork the repository to your own github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) as a private repository.
After you fork, [invite your team members to share](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

***Note:*** it is important to ensure that the repository is _private_ so other teams cannot access your code.
